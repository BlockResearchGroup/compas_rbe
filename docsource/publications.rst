Decomposing three-dimensional shapes into self-supporting discrete element assemblies
=====================================================================================

.. [Frick2015] Frick et al. 2015. Decomposing three-dimensional shapes into self-supporting discrete element assemblies.

**Ursula Frick, Tom Van Mele and Philippe Block**

    This study investigates a computational design approach to generate volumetric
    decompositions of given, arbitrary, three-dimensional shapes into self supporting,
    discrete-element assemblies.
    These assemblies are structures formed by individual units that remain in equilibrium
    solely as a result of compressive and frictional contact forces between the elements.
    This paper presents a prototypical implementation of a decomposition tool into a
    CAD software, focusing on user-controlled design to generate such assemblies.
    The implementation provides an interactive design environment including real time
    visual feedback, in which the design space of self-supporting block assemblies can
    be explored and expanded.
    Some surprising results of such explorations are included and discussed.
